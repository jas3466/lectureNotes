HW 7 due Thurs Oct 13
    - careful: proofs that require induction need to be proved with induction
        (and not using a different technique)

Exam 2 will be Thursday, October 13
    - can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes (both sides)

/////////////////////////////////

Today:

- proofs with nested quantifiers
- soundness and completeness issues in predicate logic
- one more induction proof
- exam 2 review

///////////////////////////////

Proofs with nested quantifiers.

- approach exactly the same as proofs with single quantifiers
...but, can only plug in for / introduce a single quantifier at once


Examples:

A x (A y (P(x, y))) |- A y (A x (P(x, y)))          //nested1.logika


E x (E y P(x, y)) |- E y (E x P(x, y))              //nested2.logika


A x (A y (C(x) -> D(y))), E x C(x)  |- A y D(y)     //nested3.logika


E y (A x P(x, y)) |- A x (E y P(x, y))              //nested4.logika


//////////////////////////////

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition?
    propositional: Everything we could prove (with proof rules) is actually true
    predicate logic: is sound


Completeness: definition?
    propositional: Everything that is true (with truth tables) can be proved
    predicate logic is not complete

propositional: sound and complete
predicate: sound, not complete

not complete: we can't prove everything that is true

///////////////////////////////////

Domain with integers, where predicates are different arithmetic operations

maybe predicate is addition. 2 + 3 = 5

maybe domain is: 0,1,2,3,4

       2 + 3 = 0


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be statements that
can be neither proved nor disproved.

(depends on interpretations)



Decidability - whether a problem can be decided one way or another

Halting problem - given a computer program and a set of inputs
    can you write another program to determine if the original
        program will halt for the inputs


//////////////////////////////////////

Induction: another example

Prove that for all natural numbers n >= 1:

1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 +â‹¯+ n^3 = (n^2(n+1)^2)/4

Exam 2: Thursday, October 13

- Finishing propositional logic
    - Proof by contradiction (pbc) and bottom elimination (_|_e) rules
    - Semantic entailment (a |= b)
        truth tables
        anytime a is true, then b is also true
        show a->b is a tautology
        (or show that any truth assignment that makes a true also be makes b true)
    - Proving theorems
        a V !a
        a proof with no premises
        |- (theorem)
    - Satisfiability
        p -> q
        p = T, q = T, then p->q is true
        (there is some truth assignment that makes it true)
    - Soundness and completeness
        (just definitions, what is true for prop./pred logic)
    - Showing equivalence using both truth tables and proofs
        truth tables: same set of truth assignments make both true
        prove A |- B and B |- A
    - Showing a sequent is invalid
        A |- B
        invalid if there is a truth assignment that makes premises true
            but conclusion false
- Predicate logic
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Proofs in predicate logic (including Ai, Ae, Ei, and Ee rules),
        including proofs with nested quantifiers
    - Showing equivalence using proofs
    - Explain proof rules
    - Maybe, do translations first and then prove your translations
- Mathematical induction
