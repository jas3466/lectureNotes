HW 6 due Thursday, October 6

Exam 2 will be Thursday, October 13
    - more details posted by the end of the week
    - can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes (both sides)

/////////////////////////////////

Today:

- one more proof with translations
- proof rules with the existential quantifier

///////////////////////////////

Given:

Everyone wearing a red shirt likes pizza.
Everyone who likes pizza likes donuts.
No one likes donuts.

Want to prove: No one is wearing a red shirt.


Proof: forall7.logika

////////////////////////////////

Idea behind there exists-introduction (∃i):

        P(v)
∃i: --------------
       ∃x P(x)

//v is some individual




Human(Socrates)

E x (Human(x))

If we find ONE individual in a domain where a statement holds

...then THERE EXISTS an individual in the domain where the
    statement holds


/////////////////////////////////

Example:

(exist1.logika)
Human(Socrates) |- E x (Human(x))



Example:

(exist2.logika)
A x (Human(x)->Mortal(x)), Human(Socrates) |- E x (Mortal(x))



//////////////////////////////////

Idea behind there exists-elimination (∃e):

                { a P(a)    assume
     ∃x P(x),    ... Q }
∃e: ------------------------------
                  Q

//think of a as an alias for the individual the E statement held for
//a is "fresh" (never used before)


If we know there is at least one individual where some statement holds

...then we can introduce a (or whatever) as an ALIAS for that
    individual in a subproof

    ...whatever conclusion we reach in the subproof must be true
        overall, since a was an EXISTING individual



Structure of the subproof:

3. E x P (x)
4. {
    5. a P(a)       assume //plug into your E statement
    ...
    10. Q
}
11. Q               Ee 3 4



**If you have an E statement as a premise, you almost always
want to start with a block where you create an alias (e.g. a)
and plug it into your E statement, as above

///////////////////////////////

Examples:

(exist3.logika)
A x (Human(x)->Mortal(x)), E x (Human(x)) |- E x (Mortal(x))


(exist4.logika)
E x (P(x)) |-E y (P(y))


(exist5.logika)
∃x (P(x) V Q(x)) ⊢ (∃x P(x)) V (∃x Q(x))


(exist6.logika)
A x (Q(x) -> H(x)), E x (P(x) ^ Q(x)) ⊢ ∃ x (P(x) ^ H(x))


(exist7.logika)
E x (!P(x) ^ !Q(x)) |- E x (!(P(x) V Q(x)))

////////////////////////////

Proof tactics for predicate logic

- see if you can do anything right away with the premises
    - ^ elimination
    - ->, and the LHS, do ->e
    - A, individual, Ae

- look at top-level operator for what you are trying to prove
    trying to prove A x (P(x)):
        pattern for Ai
        subproof where I introduce a random individual
        by end of subproof: P(randomIndividual)

    trying to prove E x (P(x)):
        usually have a E statement as a premise
        assume an alias for the E statement in a subproof
        get E x (P(x)) at end of subproof (*)will probably need Ei on your alias)
        afterwards claim E x (P(x)) using Ee

    trying to prove ->
        subproof
        assume LHS
        get to RHS
        afterwards use ->i to conclude LHS->RHS

    trying to prove !(something)
        assume something in subproof
        get _|_
        afterwards, use !i to conclude !(something)



    trying to prove an V
        can you get just one side? then use Vi
        do you have an V statement? use Ve
        do you have a E statement?
            assume an alias for the E statement in a subproof
            get V statement at end of subproof
            afterwards claim V statement using Ee

    when you are in a subproof, think about what you are trying
    to prove. Find its top-level operator, approach as above.


Unsure what to do?
    - Do you have an V statement available? try Ve

    - Do you have an E statement available? use an Ee subproof, try to
        get to your goal conclusion

    - Is negation involved, but not creating !(something)?

Equivalences in predicate logic:

example sentences in English

P(x): person x attends K-State
Q(x): person x attends KU


¬ (∃x P(x)) is equivalent to ∀x ¬ P(x)
There is no person who attends K-State
All people don't attend K-State.

(equiv1.logika and equiv2.logika)

(**** STOPPED HERE ****)
(**** will do other direction of equivalence on Thurs Oct 6 ***(

//////////////////////////////////////////////


A x P(x) -> !Q(x) is equivalent to !(E x P(x) ^ Q(x))
(equiv3.logika and equiv4.logika)

¬ (∀x P(x)) is equivalent to ∃x ¬ P(x)
(equiv5.logika and equiv6.logika)
