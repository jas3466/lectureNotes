HW 14 due Thurs Dec 8

Final exam is Thursday, December 15 2:00-3:50

Will review for the final on Thursday

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- finish verifying sort
- programs with multiple functions, in practice
- global variables and global invariants

////////////////////////////////

Finish verifying sort (sort.logika)

////////////////////////////////

Programs with multiple functions, in practice:

- If you are calling a function someone else wrote
    - You probably can't see that code
    - You want that function's specification (pre/post conditions)
        to be as specific as possible

- If you are writing a function
    - Supply a GOOD specification
    - Often best to write the specification before the code


It is good to do this in the documentation even when your
programs aren't formally verified.

////////////////////////////////////

Global variables and global invariants.

- Multiple functions might share the same global variables
- (true for fields/properties when writing general classes)

- Will add GLOBAL INVARIANTS specifying what must always be true
    about global variables

- Global invariants must be true initially (using the initial variable values)

- If a function works with global variables:
    - What do we know about global invariants at beginning of function?
        --> What could we do with them in manual mode?

    - What needs to be true about global invariants by the end of the function?
        --> What would we need to do with them in manual mode?



- After returning from a function call, what do we know about global invariants?
    --> What could we do with them in manual mode?

/////////////////////////////////////

Bank example (bank.logika)

Global variables:
    - account balance
    - "elite" status (a boolean for whether the balance is >= 1 million)

Global invariants:
    - balance should be non-negative
    - elite status should match balance

////////////////////////////////////

Hall passes example (hallPasses.logika)

////////////////////////////////////

Thursday:
- specifications and assertions in practice
- termination
- review for final exam
