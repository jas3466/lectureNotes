Final exam is Thursday, December 15 2:00-3:50


////////////////////////////////

Today:
- finish hall passes example with global variables
- termination
- review for final

Finish hall passes example (hallPasses.logika)

Termination

Partial Correctness:
    - if the function/procedure’s pre-condition holds,
    - and if it terminates,
    - then its post-condition is guaranteed

Total Correctness:
    - if the function/procedure’s pre-condition holds,
    - then it terminates,
    - and its post-condition is guaranteed


We need to show termination to achieve total correctness


////////////////////////

Proving termination.

We want to show:
    - The decreasing amount of work left to do
    - An indication of when the work is done

Use an integer to show the (decreasing) amount of work left
    - Each loop iteration decreases the integer
    - 0 means we are done (no more work)
    - If the integer is 0 (or less), then the loop should exit

//////////////////////////

Recall mult (slightly modified).

Will it necessarily terminate?



- Add measure tracking how much work is left
- Compute measure before and after loop body
- Prove that the measure decreases with each iteration
    (add an assert)
- Prove that if the measure is 0 or less, then the loop exits
    (might need to strengthen to invariant)


Note that proving termination isn't always possible...

See Collatz problem.

Halting problem.

Final exam review.

Cumulative.
Similar format as the midterms exams (multiple choice + open-ended).
Can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes.

/////////////////////////////////////

- Introduction to logical reasoning
    - Basic logical reasoning
    - Knights and knaves puzzles
- Propositional logic
    - Translating between English and propositional logic
    - Truth tables, top-level operators,
            tautology/contingent/contradictory, satisfiability
    - Propositional logic proofs
        and, or, implies, and negation rules
    - Semantic entailment (uses truth tables)
        p semantically entails q if p->q is a tautology
    - Logical equivalence (with proofs and with truth tables)
    - Soundness and completeness
        soundness: anything that I can prove (with proof rules)
                    is actually true

        completeness: everything that is true can be proved
- Predicate logic
    - Universal and existential quantifiers
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Predicate logic proofs with Ai, Ae, Ei, and Ee rules
        (including those with more than one variable
        and/or nested quantifiers)
- Programming logic (I'll specify manual/symexe for each problem)
    - Assumes and asserts
    - The subst rules
    - The algebra rule
    - Verifying asserts with variables/expressions/updating variables
        (including claims with division and modulus)
    - Verifying programs with if/else statements, functions,
        loops, recursion, sequences, and global variables/invariants
    - Function contracts
    - Loop invariant blocks
    - Verifying "test code" that calls a function
    - Interpreting and using Logika facts
    - Full vs. partial correctness, and proving termination


I strongly recommend reworking previous exams,
going through previous exam review problems, and reworking
previous homework problems.

These practice problems do not cover all exam topics.
