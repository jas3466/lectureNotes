HW 11 due tonight

HW 12 will be posted after class

Exam 3 will be Thursday, November 17
    - posted review information to Canvas
    - will spend time reviewing during class on Tuesday, November 15
    - I recommend finishing HW 12 before Exam 3

//////////////////////////////////

How to study for an exam?

open-ended problems: similar to HW and lecture

multiple choice: terms, definitions
    postcondition
    precondition
    invariant
    how do we prove a postcondition
    where do we need to prove an invariant


//////////////////////////////////

Today:

- more with verifying programs with loops
- more with creating loop invariants
- loop invariants and Logika facts


///////////////////////////////////

Another loop example: adding even numbers

another way to describe returning the sum of the first n even numbers:
    result == 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 2*n


n!:
    result = n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1

sumEvens_loop.logika

///////////////////////////////////

Repeat sumEvens with a Logika fact (sumEvens_fact.logika)

--> add function contract, loop invariant block

--> without doing proof, what how do we prove invariant?
    - how do we prove postcondition?

--> add logic block locations. What can we state as premises?
    - what are we trying to prove?

--> what do we need to do to make function call verified?

///////////////////////////////////

Postconditions/invariants that work with booleans

isAnswer.logika

check whether first two parameters add to second parameter

do slow (loop) approach to find sum

///////////////////////////////////

Next time:
- nested loops
- review for Exam 3
