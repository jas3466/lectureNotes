HW 13 due tonight

HW 14 will be posted after class - due Thurs Dec 8
    (last HW)

Final exam: Thursday, December 15 2:00-3:50 pm

/////////////////////////////////

Today:
- more with sequences

//////////////////////////////////

Function contracts with sequences:

    requires?
        make sure any position is in range
        sometimes need to make sure sequence is not empty

    modifies?
        only include if the function changes the sequence parameter

    ensures?
        describe what result is being returned
        describe how every single value in the sequence has changed
        if the sequence is modified, state that the final size is the same

Loop invariants with sequences:

    if the sequence changes:
        describe what has changed so far
        describe what is still the same
        state the lower bound for the loop counter
        state the upper bound for the loop counter
        the final size is the same


//////////////////////////////////

Review: verify a function that adds 1 to all elements in a sequence

--> what happens if we don't describe what parts haven't changed?

(addToAll.logika)

//////////////////////////////

Harder example: verify a function that returns the sum of elements
    in a sequence

(seqSum.logika)

/////////////////////////////


Write a function that returns the min element of a sequence

(seqMin.logika)

/////////////////////////////

Write selection sort that combines multiple functions
(sort.logika --> will finish next week)

/////////////////////////////

Next time: global variables and global invariants

(covers material for problems 3 and 4 on HW 14)
