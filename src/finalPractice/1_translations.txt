Translate the sentence below to propositional logic:

"I drive to work only if it is below freezing or my bicycle is broken."

1) Identify the propositional atoms

p: I drive to work
q: It is below freezing
r: My bicycle is broken

[if no exception is true], I don't drive

!(q V r) -> !p

(!q ^ !r) -> !p

p -> (q V r)

2) Translate the sentence to propositional logic:



////////////////

Domain: food

C(x, y): x costs more than y
P(x): x is produce
V(x): x is a vegetable
F(x): x is a frozen food



Using the predicates above, complete the following translations:


1) All vegetables are produce.

A x (V(x) -> P(x))


2) Some vegetables are not frozen.

E x (V(x) ^ !F(x))


3) Not all produce foods are vegetables.

!(A x (P(x) -> V(x)))

E x (P(x) ^ !V(x))


4) There is no frozen food that costs more than every vegetable.

!(E x (F(x) ^ A y (V(y) -> C(x, y))))
