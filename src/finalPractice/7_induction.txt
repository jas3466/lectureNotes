Use mathematical induction to prove that the following expression:

    n(n+1)(n+5)

Is a multiple of 3 for all integers n>=1.


Base case: Suppose n = 1. We have that:

    1(1+1)(1+5) = 1*2*6 = 12

12 is a multiple of 3, so the base case holds.



Inductive step: Assume n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3 for some n >= 1. We must show that:

    (n+1)((n+1)+1)((n+1)+5) = (n+1)(n+2)(n+6)

is also a multiple of 3.

If n(n+1)(n+5) is a multiple of 3, then either n, n+1, or n+5 is a multiple of 3.

Suppose n is a multiple of 3. Then (n+6) is also a multiple of 3, as adding 6 to a multiple of 3
yields another multiple of 3. Thus (n+1)(n+2)(n+6) is also a multiple of 3, as one its factors is a
multiple of 3.

Suppose n+1 is a multiple of 3. Thus (n+1)(n+2)(n+6) is also a multiple of 3, as one its factors is a
multiple of 3.

Suppose n+5 is a multiple of 3. Then (n+2) is also a multiple of 3, as subtracting 3 from a multiple of 3
yields another multiple of 3 (as long as n+2 is at least 3, which it is since n >= 1).
Thus (n+1)(n+2)(n+6) is also a multiple of 3, as one its factors is a multiple of 3.

In all cases, (n+1)(n+2)(n+6) is also a multiple of 3. The inductive step holds.
