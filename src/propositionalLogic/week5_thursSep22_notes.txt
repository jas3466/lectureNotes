////////////////////////////////////

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises.


Example: prove the following theorem:

(theorem1.logika)
(p -> q) -> (!q -> !p)

/////////////////////////////////

Revisiting...how do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises (^e, ->e)
3. Look at what you are trying to prove (find its top level operator)

    ^ - prove the left and right sides separately, use ^i to build

    V - do you have an OR statement already? Try OR-elimination.
        can you get just one side? (think of them as separate things)
        then use Vi. (is there negation involved? maybe try pbc
        if nothing else works. or try _|_e if you can get a contradiction
        to conclude whatever you want.)

    -> - subproof, assume LHS, get to RHS, ->i

    ! - subproof, assume is true, get _|_, use !i


Inside a subproof, think about what you are trying to prove right then.
Treat it like a separate proof, apply strategies above.

Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above:
- trying to prove just a propositional atom? Negation involved? Try pbc.
- or anytime above strategies don't work out, assume !(what you want),
    try to get _|_, use pbc


Need a contradiction? Look at all information, see where _|_ could possibly
come from. Prove whatever parts needed to get there.

As a last resort, copy/paste LEM proof to have (something) V !(something).
Use OR-elimination on it.

////////////////////////////////////

P1, ..., Pn |- C

the premises together with the conclusion
    is a sequent

P1, ..., PN *prove* C


///////////////////////////////////

A sequent is *invalid* if there exists a truth assignment
that makes the premises true but the conclusion false



Example:

p → q, r -> q |- ¬r → ¬p

Is the sequent valid?

to show invalid, find truth assignment that makes premises true
and conclusion false

T->F is false

r = F
p = T
q = T

///////////////////////////////////

Semantic entailment.

P1, ..., Pn |= C

P1, ..., Pn ENTAILS C

if whenever P1, ..., Pn are true in a truth table, then
C is also true.

IF each Pi is true, THEN we promise C is true

How could we write this in a truth table?

(P1 ^ P2 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> C

tautology

What kind of truth table would it need to be?




/////////////////////////////////////

Example: proofs with truth tables

Show that the premises entail the conclusion:

p ^ q |= p -> q

using ONE truth table

(p ^ q) -> (p -> q)

(entail3.logika)



/////////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of propositional logic

SOUNDNESS: everything that is provable is actually true

everything we can prove with our proof rules is
also true in truth tables


COMPLETENESS: everything that is true is provable

everything we can show is true in a truth table
can also be proved with our proof rules

What would it mean to be sound and complete?

that deduction proofs and entailment with truth tables were equivalent

//////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is SOUND, because whenever we use
natural deduction to prove

P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q

we can also use truth tables to show that

(P1 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> q

is a tautology


/////////////////////////////

Reasoning idea:

^e1 rule lets us have p ^ q |- p


Does p ^ q |= p?



///


^i rule lets us have p, q |- p ^ q

Does p, q |= p ^ q?


///


Would need to show this with all proof rules.



What about bottom elimination, _|_e?

Bottom elimination rule lets us do: _|_ |- anything

Does _|_ |= (anything)?




////////////////////////////////////////

Propositional logic is COMPLETE, because whenever we
use truth tables to show that

(P1 ^ ... ^ Pn) -> q

is a tautology (that P1, ..., Pn |= q)

we can also use natural deduction to prove

P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q

...idea involves turning each line of a truth table
    into a sequent

relies heavily on LEM (p V !p)



///////////////////////////////////////

Provable equivalence

Two propositional logic statements S1, S2 are
*provably equivalent* if and only if:

S1 |- S2
S2 |- S1


(how to do with one sequent?)

|- (S1 -> S2) ^ (S2 -> S1)

/////////////////////////

Semantic equivalence

Two propositional logic statements S1, S2 are
    *semantically equivalent* if and only if:

(S1 -> S2 ) ^ (S2 -> S1)


should be a tautology

/////////////////////////

Example:

First formula: (p → ¬ q)
Second formula: ¬ (p ∧ q)

Show that they are provably equivalent (provableEquivalence.logika)




Show that they are semantically equivalent (semanticEquivalence.logika)

First formula: (p → ¬ q)
Second formula: ¬ (p ∧ q)



/////////////////////////


How do you think Logika works?



    ...for proofs?

    claim           ->i m


How does this relate to compilers?

assignment statement

something = something else

/////////////////////////////////

Limitations of propositional logic:

All humans are mortal.
Socrates is human.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.


p: All humans are mortal
q: Socrates is a human
r: Socrates is mortal

p, q |- r

How would we prove this is propositional logic?

///////////////

Predicate logic:

Instead of propositions, we will break statements into:

verbs: predicates
nouns: individuals
quantifiers: specifying all individuals /
        at least one individual





///////////////

Domains: a set of individuals
(then we can make claims about different domains)

For example:
    ...the domain of all animals
    ...the domain of all people
    ...the domain of all states
    ...the domain of all college classes


Individuals are elements within a particular domain

For example:
    "Bob" might be an individual within the domain
        of all people
    "Kansas" is an individual within the domain of states
    "CIS 301" is an individual within the domain
        of all college classes





//////////////////

Predicate:
- a function that returns a boolean
- can have one or many parameters
- parameters are individuals in a particular domain

A predicate will describe a characteristic of
    an individual, or a comparison between
    multiple individuals


Example:
    Domain: people
    Maybe Alice, Bob, and Carla are individuals in
        the domain

    isAdult(takes a person)
    isMotherOf(person 1, person 2) - return whether
                person 1 is the mother of person2

    isTallerThan(person 1, person2) - return whether
                person 1 is taller than person 2

    isAdult(Alice) might be true (maybe Alice is 35)
    isAdult(Bob) might be false (Bob is 10)
    isMotherOf(Alice, Bob) might be true
    isMotherOf(Carla, Bob) might be false
    isTallerThan(Carla, Alice) might true


A x isAdult(x) - all people are adults
E x isAdult(x) - there exists a person who is an adult


/////////////////

∀ quantifier: for all (something is true FOR ALL
    elements in a domain)

∃ quantifier: there exists (THERE EXISTS at least one
    element in a domain where something is true)

∀ n P(n) means: for every individual n (in some domain),
    P(n) is true

∃ n P(n) means: there exists at least one individual n
    (in some domain) where P(n) is true



//////////////

Domain: people

    inCIS_301(x) - person x is in CIS 301
    tookExam1(x) - person x took exam 1


∀ x inCIS_301(x)  --> what does this mean?

All people are in CIS 301


∃ x tookExam1(x) --> what does this mean?

There exists (at least one) person who took exam 1




∀ x (inCIS_301(x) ^ tookExam1(x)) --> what does this mean?

All people are both in CIS 301 and took exam 1


How would we say: all people in CIS 301 took Exam 1?

∀ x (inCIS_301(x) -> tookExam1(x))





What operator usually goes with the about the ∀ quantifier?

->



How would we say: there is a person in CIS 301
    who took exam 1?

E x (inCIS_301(x) ^ tookExam1(x))


E tends to go with ^


What does this mean:

E x (inCIS_301(x) -> tookExam1(x))

would be true if:
    there is a person not in CIS 301 (making LHS of -> false)
    or if a person in 301 took exam 1
